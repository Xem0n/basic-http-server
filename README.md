# Basic HTTP Server written in C++
## About
I've made it to learn about sockets and HTTP protocol itself.  
For now, it's very vulnerable and offers support for a small number of file types, but I want to enhance this project and maybe add some kind of middleware in the future.

[Library used to manage sockets](https://github.com/ReneNyffenegger/Socket.cpp)

## Usage
First, compile using Makefile.  
Then, run like a normal console program. Enter the port you want to use as an argument.  
Put your files in public_html folder.
